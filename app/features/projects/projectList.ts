        description: `Programming languages are made from Compilers and interpreters, the interpreter takes source code and evaluates it producing some visible, intermediate result that can be later executed. The compilers produce an output in another language that the underlying system can understand.The intepreter is a mix of a lexer, a parser and a evaluator.
            Lexer The lexer takes the source code and tokenizes it, so the language knows if the current token is a '=', a identifier, a digit,... it only "marks" the text for later being parsed.
            Parser This parser is a tree-walking parser. The parser creates a Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It's called abstract because some details visible in the source code are omitted in the AST (semicolons, spaces, newlines,...). This parser is a top down operator precedence parser, sometimes called "Pratt parser", after its inventor Vaughan Pratt. This parser makes learning about making an interpreter something fun! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
            Evaluator What makes a programming language come to life from source code is a good Evaluator. When the interpreter walks by the parsing tree it evaluates every node thanks to the evaluator so an integer returns an Object.Integer, an expression, a statement is evaluated and so on. The evaluator makes the source code execute and return objects from the object system of the programming language.`,
